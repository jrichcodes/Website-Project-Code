## Description
Trip Planner is an online outdoor trip planning service that allows users to prepare for trips easily. Users must create a profile to begin planning. From there, users can log in and utilize the Events page to create a trip. After a trip is created, users have the option to delete the trip or modify it through the Trip Summary page. The Trip Summary page can be accessed by clicking on the trip on the Events page. Users can use the Trip Summary page to create trip view general information about the trip, add gear items, create a menu for the trip, or view the trip's location on a map.

One of the most convenient features of trip planner is how efficient it allows the trip planning process to become. For example, if a user wants to create a trip but is not sure where they would like to go, they can use the Trip Suggestions page to view a list of possible trips, which can be filtered by location. Additionally, if the user clicks the "Create Trip" button on one of these suggestions, the Events page will be autofilled with information such as the name, description, and location.

Some other convenient features of trip planner include:
- Scheduling tools
- Mapping tools
- Meal planning
- Grocery shopping list
- Ability to friend other users
