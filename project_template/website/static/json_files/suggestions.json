Tsunami Rock is 15m / 50ft-wide and now sits more than 100m / 30ft from the seacoast. In order to better-understand the scale of such a giant wave required to move the rock, the swells generated by the most powerful explosion in recorded history (on the Indonesian volcano Krakatau, in 1883) were 40m / 130ft-high and transported a rock the same distance\u2026 but only one-third its size."
