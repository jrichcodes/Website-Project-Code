# Sprint 3
- Josephine Rich
- jrichcodes
- Trip Planner

### What I Planned To Do
- [Add function to clear database](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/50)
- [refactor gear items in database to have set gear items for trip types](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/51)
- [finish making trip summary page pretty](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/53)
- [add automatic shopping for food items](https://github.com/jrichcodes/Website-Project-Code/issues/62)

### What I Didn't Do
- I did no fully comptete the gear items. I think I will instead make a page that has suggested gear items
that you can add to your trip.

### Problems Encountered
- making a bot to run on another page is harder than I thought
- picking elements from html pages
