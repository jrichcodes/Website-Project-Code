### What i accomplished
The problem we were left with at last sprint was the unpredictability of location entries for trips. Our code would recognize some locations while not others. I used this sprint to make that functionality more robust. I changed the api used to convert the location names to coordinates to a more functional one. At the current moment, as long as there is a recognizable location name entered, the map will be coordinated appropriatly.
