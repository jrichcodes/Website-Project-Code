### What i accomplished
Durring this sprint i worked on making sure that that ID's were randomn and not simply consecutive.
I also added a biography feture to allow users to share some info about themselves; 
to do this i neded to create a new databse table, 
create a new form so that the user could add their info and added the ability for the user to se their friends shared info.
